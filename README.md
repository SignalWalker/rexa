A library implementing [OCapN](https://github.com/ocapn/ocapn), an object-capabilities protocol simplifying development of peer-to-peer applications.

Not yet fit for actual use; wait until [1.0.0](https://github.com/SignalWalker/rexa/issues/1).

## Motivation

- Decentralized services give more power to users, and tend to be longer-lived than their centralized counterparts (ex. IRC vs. AIM, Skype, etc.)
- It is difficult to build such services, because one must reinvent many wheels to ensure security & privacy for their users
- I like Rust more than [Guile](https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-goblins) & [Racket](https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins)

## Goals

- Feature-parity & interoperation with [Goblins](https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-goblins)
- Compliance with the final version of [OCapN](https://github.com/ocapn/ocapn)
  - Passes the [OCapN test suite](https://github.com/ocapn/ocapn-test-suite)

## Todo

- [ ] Agnosticize with regard to async runtime

## Etymology

- "R" as in "Rust"
- "Exa" as in:
  - "[exo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exo-)", a prefix meaning "outer" or "external"
  - "[Exapunks](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/)", a puzzle game about distributed programming
